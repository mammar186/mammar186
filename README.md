# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Ammar  
### React Native Developer | TypeScript | Expo | Supabase | Zustand | React Three Fiber

I'm a passionate React Native developer focused on building high-quality, cross-platform mobile apps.  
I love working with performance-optimized components, clean UI/UX, smooth animations, and real-time app features.

I recently completed my BS in Computer Science from COMSATS Lahore and have hands-on experience in both  
**multiplayer game logic**, **offline-first architectures**, and **3D mobile interfaces** using React Three Fiber.
